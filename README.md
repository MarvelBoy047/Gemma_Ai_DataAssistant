## 🌍 **The Global Impact Challenge We're Solving**

### **The Problem: Data Science Inequality**
- **98% of small businesses** lack access to professional data analysis capabilities.
- **Medical researchers in developing countries** can't afford expensive cloud AI services.
- **Students and educators** are blocked by subscription fees and internet requirements.
- **Privacy-sensitive organizations** (healthcare, finance, government) can't use cloud-based AI tools.
- **Rural areas with limited internet** are excluded from the AI revolution.

> [!NOTE]
> Our mission is to eliminate these barriers by providing a tool that is zero-cost, fully offline, and guarantees bank-level privacy by design.

## 🚀 **How It Works: The Dual-Agent Intelligence Pipeline**

Our system uses two coordinated AI agents to deliver a seamless experience from user request to final report.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[🗂️ User Uploads Data & Gives Prompt] --> B{📱 Planner Agent (app.py)}
    B --> C{📝 Proposes Analysis Plan}
    C --> D{✅ User Approves Plan}
    D --> E{👨‍💻 Executor Agent (coding_agent.py)}
    E --> F[1. Generates Code]
    F --> G[2. Executes in Notebook]
    G --> H{💥 Error?}
    H -- Yes --> I[3. Self-Heals with RAG]
    I --> F
    H -- No --> J[📊 Appends Results]
    J --> E
    E -- All Tasks Done --> K[📋 Generates Final Summary & Notebook]

    subgraph "Knowledge Base (RAG)"
        L[📚 knowledge_base.json]
        M[🔍 FAISS Vector Search]
    end

    B -- Reads --> L
    I -- Learns from --> L
```

1.  **UI & Planning (`app.py`)**: The user interacts with a Streamlit front-end. This "Planner Agent" uses a RAG system on `knowledge_base.json` to understand the user's request and propose a high-level, logical plan for approval.
2.  **Autonomous Execution (`coding_agent.py`)**: Once the user approves the plan, a background "Executor Agent" takes over. This powerful agent works autonomously to:
    -   Generate production-quality Python code for each step.
    -   Execute the code within a Jupyter kernel.
    -   **Self-Heal**: If an error occurs, it uses its own RAG-powered error correction system to search its knowledge base for a solution, rewrite the code, and try again.
3.  **Final Output**: Once all tasks are complete, the agent generates a final summary and provides the complete, documented Jupyter notebook.

## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide**

> [!NOTE]
> This is a condensed guide. For a comprehensive, step-by-step walkthrough, please see the **[Installation & Setup Instructions](Installation%20setup%20Instructions.md)** file.

### **Step 1: Install Ollama & Download Models**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Ollama server must be running in the background for the assistant to function. The models are a one-time download.

```bash
# 1. Download and install Ollama from https://ollama.com

# 2. Start the Ollama service in a separate terminal
ollama serve

# 3. Download the required AI models
ollama pull gemma:2b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

### **Step 2: Clone Repository & Install Dependencies**

> [!TIP]
> Using a Python virtual environment is highly recommended to avoid conflicts with other projects.

```bash
# Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/MarvelBoy047/Gemma_Ai_DataAssistant.git
cd Gemma_Ai_DataAssistant

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

# Install all required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 3: Launch the Application**

```bash
# Start the Streamlit web application
streamlit run app.py

# Your browser will automatically open to http://localhost:8501
```

## 🏗️ **Project Architecture & File Structure**

The project's intelligence is driven by a decoupled, dual-agent architecture that communicates through the file system, ensuring robustness and scalability.

### **Key Component Roles:**

*   **`app.py` (The Planner & UI):**
    *   Manages the user-facing Streamlit application.
    *   Takes the user's natural language request and uses a FAISS-powered RAG search on the `knowledge_base.json` to find relevant tasks.
    *   Asks Gemma to create a high-level analysis plan, which is then presented to the user for approval.

*   **`coding_agent.py` (The Autonomous Executor):**
    *   Runs in a background thread, constantly monitoring the `chat_history` directory for new tasks approved by the user.
    *   This agent is the workhorse: it generates, executes, and debugs Python code step-by-step.
    *   Features a multi-layered, self-healing mechanism that uses the `knowledge_base.json` to fix its own errors.

*   **`knowledge_base.json` (The Shared Brain):**
    *   A repository of over 100 trusted data science code patterns and task descriptions.
    *   It serves both the Planner Agent (for creating plans) and the Executor Agent (for RAG-based error correction).

> [!TIP]
> **The Asynchronous Communication Bus**
> The `app.py` front-end and the `coding_agent.py` back-end are fully decoupled. They communicate asynchronously by writing and reading JSON files in the `chat_history` directory. This robust, file-based messaging system is what allows the agent to work on complex, long-running tasks in the background without freezing the UI.
